Installing Py4J
===============

Installing Python 2.6+ or 3.4
-----------------------------

Py4J is a library written in Python and Java. Currently, Py4J has been tested
with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.4, but it should also be compatible with Python 3.3.
You can install Python by going to the `official Python download page
<http://www.python.org/download/>`_.


Installing Java 6
-----------------

You also need to install a Java environment, version 6. You can install a Java
environment by going to the `official Java download page
<http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp>`_ You will need to download
the JDK if you plan to use the Java compiler, but you only need the JRE if you
are using another compiler, such as the one provided by the `Eclipse
Development Environment <http://www.eclipse.org>`_.


Installing Py4J
---------------

There are three ways to install Py4J:

Using easy_install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Run ``easy_install py4j`` (don't forget to prefix with sudo if you install
   Py4J system-wide on a \*NIX operating system).
2. Py4J should now be in your PYTHONPATH.
3. The Py4J Java library is located in ``share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar``. The exact
   location depends on the platform and the installation type. Some likely
   locations are:

   1. ``/usr/share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar`` for system-wide install on Linux.
   2. ``{virtual_env_dir}/share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar`` for installation in a
      virtual environment.
   3. ``C:\python27\share\py4j\py4j0.x.jar`` for system-wide install on
      Windows.

Using an official release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the latest official release from `SourceForge
   <https://sourceforge.net/projects/py4j/files/>`_ or from `PyPI
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py4j>`_. If you are using a \*NIX OS, download
   the tar.gz file. If you are using Windows, download the zip file.
2. Untar/Unzip the file and navigate to the newly created directory, e.g., ``cd
   py4j-0.x``.
3. Run ``python setup.py install`` (don't forget to prefix with sudo if you
   install Py4J system-wide).
4. Py4J should now be in your PYTHONPATH.
5. The Py4J Java library is located under ``py4j-java/py4j0.x.jar``.  Add this
   library to your classpath when using Py4J in a Java program.

Using the latest development source code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will provide detailed instructions to build Py4J in future releases.
Briefly, you need:

1. `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ to download the latest source code.
   Execute the command line ``git clone https://github.com/bartdag/py4j.git
   py4j`` to download the source code.
2. `Apache ant <http://ant.apache.org>`_ to build the Py4J Java library execute
   the command line ``ant jar`` in the py4j-java project directory to build the
   code and create a jar file.
3. `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to build the documentation. Just
   execute the command line ``make html``  in the
   py4j-web project.
4. `nose <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/>`_ to test the Py4J Python
   library.

Execute the command line ``ant python-light-release`` in the py4j-java
directory to create a tar.gz and zip source distribution. The
``python-light-release`` target will (1) build the Py4J Java library, (2)
build the documentation, and (3) build the Py4J Python library and package it
into a tar.gz and zip source distribution.

Maven install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the source code as explained above.
2. Go to the py4j-java directory and execute ``mvn install``.
3. Alternatively, if a test fails (possible because of sockets), execute
   ``mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install``
4. Builded binaries will be in the directory ``target/py4j-0.x.jar``.
