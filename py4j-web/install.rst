Installing Py4J
===============

Installing Python 2.7 or 3.4-3.6
--------------------------------

Py4J is a library written in Python and Java. Currently, Py4J has been tested
with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. You can install Python by going to the
`official Python download page <http://www.python.org/download/>`_.


Installing Java 6+
------------------

You also need to install a Java environment, version 6 (7 and 8 are also
supported). You can install a Java environment by going to the `official Java
download page
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ You will
need to download the JDK if you plan to use the Java compiler, but you only
need the JRE if you are using another compiler, such as the one provided by the
`Eclipse Development Environment <http://www.eclipse.org>`_.


Installing Py4J
---------------

There are three ways to install Py4J:

Using easy_install or pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Run ``pip install py4j`` or ``easy_install py4j`` (don't forget
   to prefix with sudo if you install Py4J system-wide on a
   \*NIX operating system).
2. Py4J should now be in your PYTHONPATH.
3. The Py4J Java library is located in ``share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar``. The exact
   location depends on the platform and the installation type. Some likely
   locations are:

   1. Either ``/usr/share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar`` or ``/usr/local/share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar`` for system-wide install on Linux.
   2. ``{virtual_env_dir}/share/py4j/py4j0.x.jar`` for installation in a
      virtual environment.
   3. ``C:\python27\share\py4j\py4j0.x.jar`` for system-wide install on
      Windows.

Using an official release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the latest official release from from `PyPI
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py4j>`_. If you are using a \*NIX OS, download
   the tar.gz file. If you are using Windows, download the zip file.
2. Untar/Unzip the file and navigate to the newly created directory, e.g., ``cd
   py4j-0.x``.
3. Run ``python setup.py install`` (don't forget to prefix with sudo if you
   install Py4J system-wide).
4. Py4J should now be in your PYTHONPATH.
5. The Py4J Java library is located under ``py4j-java/py4j0.x.jar``.  Add this
   library to your classpath when using Py4J in a Java program.

.. _build_instructions:

Using the latest development source code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install the latest version with pip and git:
``pip install git+https://github.com/bartdag/py4j.git``

Otherwise, to build the Java and Python libraries, you need:

1. `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to download the latest source code.
   Execute the command line ``git clone https://github.com/bartdag/py4j.git
   py4j`` to download the source code.
2. `Gradle <https://gradle.org>`_ to build the Py4J Java library execute the
   command line ``./gradlew assemble`` in the py4j-java project directory to
   build the code and create a jar file. The jar file you are looking for is
   ``py4j-java/py4jXYZ.jar`` where XYZ is the current version of Py4J.
3. `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to build the documentation. Just
   execute the command ``make html``  in the py4j-web directory.
4. Libraries such as `nose <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/>`_ to test the
   Py4J Python library. Just run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in
   py4j directory.

Here are a few useful commands to build Py4J:

1. ``cd py4j-java; ./gradlew buildPython`` - builds the Py4J Java library in a
   jar, the documentation, and the Python binary and source distributions. The
   source and wheel distributions will be in ``py4j-python/dist`` directory
   (e.g., ``py4j-python/dist/py4j-0.10.0.tar.gz``).
2. ``cd py4j-java; ./gradlew bundles`` - builds the Py4J Java Library as a OSGi
   bundle (in build/plugins).
3. ``cd py4j-java; ./gradlew updateSite`` - builds the Eclipse update site (in
   build/updatesite).
4. ``cd py4j-java; ./gradlew check`` - runs Java tests, FindBugs, and Java
   coding conventions checks. (Python checks will be added in the future).
5. ``cd py4j-python; flake8`` - performs flake8 check on Python source code.
6. ``cd py4j-python; nosetests`` - runs Python test suite.


Maven install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the source code as explained above.
2. Go to the py4j-java directory and execute ``mvn install``.
3. Alternatively, if a test fails (possible because of sockets), execute
   ``mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install``
4. Builded binaries will be in the directory ``target/py4j-0.x.jar``.
