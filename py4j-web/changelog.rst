Changelog
=========

The changelog describes in plain English the changes that occurred between Py4J releases.

Py4J 0.8.2.1
------------

- Fixed a test that used an assert method that does not exist in Python 2.6

Py4J 0.8.2
----------

- Fixed constructors not being able to pass proxy (python classes implementing
  Java interfaces)
- Java 6 compatibility was restored in compiled jar file.
- Fixed unit tests for JDK 8
- Added a few extra paths to find_jar_path
- `github 0.8.2 milestone
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?milestone=11&state=closed>`_


Py4J 0.8.1
----------

- Fixed a bug in type inference when interface hierarchy is deeper than
  abstract class hierarchy.
- Added a utility method ``is_instance_of`` in py4j.java_gateway to determine
  if a JavaObject is an instance of a class.
- Released Py4J in central Maven repository.
- `github 0.8.1 milestone
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?milestone=8&page=1&state=closed>`_


Py4J 0.8
--------

- Major fix to the Java byte[] support. Thanks to @agronholm for spotting
  this subtle but major issue and thanks to @fdinto from The Atlantic for
  providing a patch!
- Ability to fail early if the py4j.java_gateway.JavaGateway cannot connect to
  the JVM.
- Added support for long primitives, BigDecimal, enum types, and inner classes
  on the Java side.
- Set saner log levels
- Many small bug fixes and API enhancements (backward compatible).
- Wrote a section in the FAQ about security concerns and precautions with Py4J.
- Added support of `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/bartdag/py4j>`_ and
  cleaned up the test suite to remove hardcoded paths.
- `github 0.8 milestone
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=closed>`_

Py4J 0.7
--------

- Major refactoring to support Python 3. Thanks to Alex Gr√∂nholm for his
  patch.
- The build and setup files have been totally changed. Py4J no longer requires
  Paver to build and everything is done through ant. The setup.py file only
  uses distutils.
- Added support for Java byte[]: byte array are passed by value and converted
  to bytearray or bytes.
- Py4J package name changed from Py4J to py4j.
- Bug fixes in the Python callback server and unicode support.
- `github 0.7 milestone
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.7>`_

Py4J 0.6
--------

- Added new exception ``Py4JJavaError`` that enables Python client programs to access
  instance of Java exception thrown in the Java client code.
- Improved Py4J setup: no more warnings displayed when installing Py4J.
- Bug fixes and API additions.
- `github 0.6 milestone
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.6>`_

Py4J 0.5
--------

- Added the ability to import packages (e.g., ``java_import(gateway.jvm, 'java.io.*')``)
- Added support for pattern filtering in ``JavaGateway.help()`` (e.g., ``gateway.help(obj,'get*Foo*Bar')``)
- Added support for automatic conversion of Python collections (list, set,
  dictionary) to Java collections. User ``JavaGateway(auto_convert=True)`` or
  an explicit convertor.
- Created two Eclipse features: one embeds the Py4J
  Java library. The other
  provides a default GatewayServer that is started when Eclipse starts. Both
  features are available on the new Py4J Eclipse update site:
  ``http://py4j.sourceforge.net/py4j_eclipse``
- Redesigned the module decomposition of Py4J: there are no more mandatory circular dependencies among modules.
- `github 0.5 milestone
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.5>`_

Py4J 0.4
--------

- Polishing of existing features: fields can be set (not just read), None is accepted as a method parameter, methods are sorted alhabetically in gateway.help(), etc.
- Java Exception Stack Trace are now propagated to Python side.
- Changed **interfaces** member in Callback classes to **implements**.
- Internal refactoring to adopt clearer terminology and make Py4J protocol extensible.
- Many bug fixes: most are related to the callback feature.
- `github 0.4 milestone <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.4>`_

Py4J 0.3
--------

- Added support for Java arrays and set.
- Added support for callbacks: Java objects can now call back Python objects.
- Completely redesigned threading and connection model of Py4J to allow multiple threads and callbacks on both side.
- Refactored the memory management to ensure best effort garbage collection.
- `github 0.3 milestone <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.3>`_

Py4J 0.2
--------

- It is now possible to call constructors and reference static members: use the `jvm` member of a `JavaGateway` object.
- Java Map is converted to a Python Dictionary.
- Field access is supported through the ``get_field`` function or the ``auto_field=True`` member of `JavaGateway`.
- Obtain an interactive help page with ``JavaGateway.help(object)``.
- Set is only accessible through the Java Set interface for now.
- Arrays can be referenced, but individual items can only be accessed with this workaround: ``gateway.jvm.java.lang.reflect.Array.get(object,index)``.
- Complete rewrite of the reflection engine on the Java side for more flexibility.
- Improved memory model: no more memory leak caused by Py4J.
- New concurrency model: Py4J is now thread-safe.
- `github 0.2 milestone <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.2>`_

Py4J 0.1
--------

- This is the first release.
- Basic features like connecting to a JVM and calling methods are implemented.
- Java List is converted to a Python List.
- Field access, constructors, and static classes are **NOT** accessible yet.
- Dictionary and Set are only accessible through the Java Map and Set interface for now.
- Arrays can be referenced, but individual items cannot be accessed yet.
- `github 0.1 milestone <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/labels/v0.1>`_
