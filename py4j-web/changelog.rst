- `tickets closed for 0.10.3 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.3+is%3Aclosed>`_

Py4J 0.10.2.1
-------------

- Release date: June 20th 2016
- Python side: re-added missing parameter in GatewayClient constructor.
- `tickets closed for 0.10.2.1 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.2.1+is%3Aclosed>`_


Py4J 0.10.2
-----------

- Release date: June 19th 2016
- Both sides: added memory management options to disable garbage collection.
  This is useful if you create many short-lived py4j client/server pairs.
- Both sides: fixed ClientServer to allow users to creater multiple
  ClientServer instances. Thanks to @jonahkichwacoders for reporting the bug
  and helping diagnosing the issue.
- Both sides: it is now possible to specify a python entry point when creating
  a CallbackServer. The CallbackClient on the Java side can then access the
  python entry point and drive the conversation. See the :ref:`advanced topics
  guide <python_entry_point>` for more information.
- Both sides: fixed memory leak issue with ClientServer and potential deadlock
  issue by creating a memory leak test suite.
- Both sides: fixed retry logic by only retrying if an error occurs on write
  (send command). Thanks to @jonahkichwacoders for raising the issue.
- Both sides: the assemble gradle task, the Java test suite and the Python test
  suite now runs correctly on Windows.
- Java side: added GatewayServerBuilder and ClientServerBuilder to ease the
  creation of these instances with many options. Thanks to @jonahkichwacoders.
- A link to the contributing guide now appears when opening pull requests or
  issues.
- `tickets closed for 0.10.2 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.2+is%3Aclosed>`_

Py4J 0.10.1
-----------

- Release date: May 11th 2016
- Major performance fix: the Python side is now using default buffering when
  reading responses from the Java side. This is particularly important if you
  transfer large parameters (large strings or byte arrays). A simple benchmark
  found that repeatedly sending 10 MB strings went from 99 seconds to 1 second.
  Thanks to @kaytwo for finding this bug and suggesting a fix.
- Both the Java and the Python libraries are now available as OSGi bundles.
  Thanks to `kichwacoders <https://kichwacoders.com/>`_ for
  funding the work.
- The 0.10.0 jar uploaded to PyPI wrongly required Java 8. The Java
  compatibility has been restored to 1.6. Thansk to @agronholm for finding this
  bug.
- Added the __version__ attribute in the py4j package to conform to PEP396.
  Thanks to @lessthanoptimal for reporting this bug.
- `tickets closed for 0.10.1 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.1+is%3Aclosed>`_

Py4J 0.10.0
-----------

- Release date: April 18th 2016
- Added a new threading model that is more efficient with indirect recursion
  between Java and Python and that enables users to control which thread will
  execute calls. Thanks to `kichwacoders <https://kichwacoders.com/>`_ for
  funding the implementation and providing the initial idea.
- Added TLS support to encrypt the communication between both sides. Thanks to
  @njwhite.
- Added initial byte stream support so Python can consume Java byte streams
  more efficiently. Support is still preliminary and subject to change in the
  future, but it provides a good base to build on. See these `Python unit test
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/blob/9d3a520d9a31ea39534d2d290eaa7da5dc683ed5/py4j-python/src/py4j/tests/java_gateway_test.py#L547>`_
  and `Java example class
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/blob/9d3a520d9a31ea39534d2d290eaa7da5dc683ed5/py4j-java/src/test/java/py4j/examples/ExampleClass.java#L192>`_
  for a small example. Thanks to @njwhite.
- Java side: converted build script from ant to gradle. Introduced Java coding
  conventions and static code analysis. See :ref:`Java Coding Conventions
  <java_conventions>` for more details.
- Java side: it is now possible to build a osgi bundle and an Eclipse update
  site from Py4J source. See :ref:`using Py4J with Eclipse <eclipse_features>`
- `tickets closed for 0.10.0 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10+is%3Aclosed>`_

Py4J 0.9.2
----------

- Release date: March 12th 2016
- Python side: added a guard condition in object finalization to prevent
  exceptions when the program exits (long standing bug!).
- Java side: Py4J will use the current thread's classloader instead of the root
  classloader to load a class from a fully qualified name. This behavior is
  configurable globally in py4j.reflection.ReflectionUtil. thanks to
  @JoshRosen.
- Documentation: made a simpler and easier to understand example of callback
  (Java calling Python)
- `tickets closed for 0.9.2 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.2>`_

Py4J 0.9.1
----------

- Release date: January 9th 2016
- Python side: it is now possible to retrieve the listening address and port of
  the CallbackServer. This is useful if CallbackServer is bound to port 0.
- Python side: The daemonize_redirect flag is not set to True by default to
  preserve backward compatibility prior to 0.9.
- Python side: JavaGateway.shutdown() no longer raises unecessary NoneType
  exceptions.
- Python side: if you attempt to access an inexistent object on the Java side,
  you will receive a more meaningful exception.
- Python side: the callback server was not correctly closing sockets and it was
  possible to leak sockets until no more were available. This has been fixed.
- Java side: the finalization code telling the Python side that it can garbage
  collect a python proxy should not longer block (major bug fix).
- Java side: After GatewayServer is launched, it is :ref:`now possible to
  change the address:port where the CallbackClient connects <dynamic_ports>`.
- Added a comment in an empty init file so 7zip does not report on error on
  Windows (go figure :-) )
- We moved from Travis CI to Circle CI and the automated tests now reliably
  pass.
- `tickets closed for 0.9.1 release
  <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.9.1+is%3Aclosed>`_


Py4J 0.9
--------

- Release date: July 25th 2015
- Python side: constructor parameters have been deprecated in favor of
  GatewayParameters and CallbackServerParameters. This was necessary because
  the number of configuration options is growing fast. Old parameters will be
  supported until Py4J 1.0 (at least two more minor versions).
- Python side: IDEs and interactive interpreters such as IPython can now get
  help text/autocompletion for Java classes, objects, and members. This makes
  Py4J an ideal tool to explore complex Java APIs (e.g., the Eclipse API).
  Thanks to @jonahkichwacoders
- Python side: the callback gateway server (necessary for Java to call back
  Python functions) can be daemonized and can be started after the main
  JavaGateway is started.
- Python side: py4j.java_gateway.launch_gateway has now a cleaner
  implementation that discards stdout and stderr output by default. It is also
  possible to redirect the output from these channels to separate files,
  deques, or queues. Thanks to @davidcsterratt for finding the root cause and
  work on the fix.
- It is now possible to install Py4J from git with pip: pip install
  git+https://github.com/bartdag/py4j.git
- The Eclipse components of Py4J have been moved to another repository. Existing
  forks and pull requests can still use the @before-eclipse-split branch until
  Py4J reaches 1.0. Fixes won't be backported to this branch, but pull requests
  will be merged by the main maintainer to @master if requested.
- Major cleanup of Python source code to make it fully flake8 (pep8 + pyflakes)
  compliant. This should be easier to contribute now.
- Major test cleanup effort to make Python tests more reliable. Testing Py4J is
  difficult because there are many versions of Python and Java to test and
  Python 2.6 lacks many interesting test features. Effort to make tests even
  more robust will continue in the next milestone.
- We introduced a :doc:`contributing guide and an implicit contributor license
  agreement </contributing>` that indicates that anyone contributing to Py4J
  keeps the copyright of the contribution but gives a non-revokable right to
  license the code using Py4J's license (3-clause BSD). The copyright statement
  has been changed to "Copyright (c) 2009-2015, Barthelemy Dagenais and
  individual contributors.  All rights reserved." to make it clear that
  individual contributors retain copyrights of their contributions. An
  AUTHORS.txt file has been added to the repository to keep track of
  contributors: if your name is not in the file and you have contributed to
  Py4J, do not hesitate to write on the mailing list or open a pull request.
- Cleaned up the doc that was referring to broken links or refactored classes.
  Long-time users may want to review the :doc:`advanced topics
  </advanced_topics>` page.
- Added support for `Python Wheels <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`_.
- We have a new website: `https://www.py4j.org <https://www.py4j.org>`_
- We have a new blog: `https://blog.py4j.org <https://blog.py4j.org>`_
- Eclipse features have moved to: `http://eclipse.py4j.org
  <http://eclipse.py4j.org>`_
- We have a `new mailing list
  <https://groups.google.com/a/py4j.org/forum/#!forum/py4j/join>`_.
