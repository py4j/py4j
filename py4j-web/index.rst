Welcome to Py4J
===============

Py4J enables Python programs running in a Python interpreter to dynamically
access Java objects in a Java Virtual Machine. Methods are called as if the
Java objects resided in the Python interpreter and Java collections can be
accessed through standard Python collection methods. Py4J also enables Java
programs to call back Python objects. Py4J is distributed under the `BSD
license <https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_.

Here is a brief example of what you can do with Py4J. The following Python
program creates a `java.util.Random` instance from a JVM and calls some of its
methods. It also accesses a custom Java class, `AdditionApplication` to add the
generated numbers.

::

  >>> from py4j.java_gateway import JavaGateway
  >>> gateway = JavaGateway()                   # connect to the JVM
  >>> random = gateway.jvm.java.util.Random()   # create a java.util.Random instance
  >>> number1 = random.nextInt(10)              # call the Random.nextInt method
  >>> number2 = random.nextInt(10)
  >>> print(number1, number2)
  (2, 7)
  >>> addition_app = gateway.entry_point               # get the AdditionApplication instance
  >>> value = addition_app.addition(number1, number2) # call the addition method
  >>> print(value)
  9

This is the Java program that was executing at the same time (no code was
generated and no tool was required to run these programs). The
`AdditionApplication app` instance is the `gateway.entry_point` in the
previous code snippet. Note that the Java program must be started before
executing the Python code above. In other words, the Py4J does not start a
JVM.

.. code-block:: java

  import py4j.GatewayServer;

  public class AdditionApplication {

    public int addition(int first, int second) {
      return first + second;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      AdditionApplication app = new AdditionApplication();
      // app is now the gateway.entry_point
      GatewayServer server = new GatewayServer(app);
      server.start();
    }
  }
