Py4J
====

Py4J enables Python programs running in a Python interpreter to dynamically
access Java objects in a Java Virtual Machine. Methods are called as if the
Java objects resided in the Python interpreter and Java collections can be
accessed through standard Python collection methods. Py4J also enables Java
programs to call back Python objects.

The latest compiled release is available in the current-release directory.

This is the source repository of Py4J projects. Please visit the `Py4J homepage
